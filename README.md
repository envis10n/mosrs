# MOSrs

A MOS6502 emulation library.

## Another 6502?

This project is specifically meant to ONLY emulate the original MOS6502 chip, providing some baseline traits for interfacing with various bus and controller emulations.

## Bus / Controller Traits

Exposed are some traits that can be implemented on your own types, that will define basic interaction between the 6502 and whatever you are writing.
